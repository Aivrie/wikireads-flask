# WikiReads

![Design preview for the Shortly URL shortening API coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Hi There! :wave:

The WikiReads web application was built for the curious at heart. I've always looooved reading random facts so this was a pleasire to build.

The WikiReads generates random articles at the click of a button. Once the article is generated, you have access to the article link which you can visit and read at your leisure.

The project was built using the Flask micro frame work and Python libraries such as wikipedia nad wikipedia-API. All dependencies arelisted in the requirements.txt file.

## Testing WikiReads on Your Browser

1. Once you clone the repo on your computer, open the file using an IDE (I personally prefer VSCode)

2. Open the project in your command line by pressing 'Ctrl + `"

3. At the directory prompt, type venv\Scripts\activate.bat (Windows) to enter the virtual enviroment

4. Type app.py at the directory prompt. The app will prepare to run and generate a domain address: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

5. Visit the address in your browser to view the project.

**Yay!!! Thanks for stopping by :rocket:**
